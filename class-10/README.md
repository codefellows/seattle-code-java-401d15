# Class 10: Stacks & Queues

Today we'll be learning your second and third data structures in Java, which are closely related: stacks and queues.

## Class Outline

- Announcements
  - Weekly feedback number 2! Please give lots of feedback!
- Warmup questions
- Lecture
  - Stacks & queues
    - Visual
    - Code
- Code Challenge intro

## Learning Objectives

### Students will be able to

#### Describe and Define

- Stacks
- Top/bottom nodes
- Push/pop operations
- Queues
- Front/back nodes
- Enqueue/dequeue operations
- Peek operation
- FIFO / LIFO semantics

#### Execute

- Implement stacks and queues, and a few common operations
- Getting more comfortable with Big O time and additional space complexity

## Helpful Resources

- [Oracle recommends using classes that implement the Deque interface for stack/queue functionality](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Deque.html)
  - [Specifically, you probably want to use ArrayDeque in real programs](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/ArrayDeque.html)
