# Code 401: Advanced Software Development in Java with SpringMVC and Android

## Overview

Learn the language used at Google, Amazon, Netflix and other big companies. Gain an understanding of statically typed languages and gain a leg up on learning other languages in the future.

Learn to write clean, crystal-clear, well-tested, advanced Java code using industry standard software engineering patterns while building servers with SpringMVC and building mobile apps with Android.

Students will use IntelliJ IDEA and Android Studio to create Java applications. Students will use Heroku to deploy the applications onto live servers. Students will install Android applications onto their own phones and have the apps communicate with Firebase, Google's realtime database.

The course focuses on fundamental computer science concepts like object-oriented programming, advanced data structures and algorithms, Big O asymptotic analysis, and the structure of statically typed languages.

## Assignments, Deadlines, Late Work, and other fun things

There are several types of assignments that are required for this course, and they have different policies on late work.

#### Complete/incomplete

* Readings: All readings are visible at the beginning of the course. Each reading is due by the start of the lecture that covers that reading, and locks (no late submissions) at midnight on that day.
* Daily Journals: Each daily journal will become available 2 hours before lecture, is due by the start of lecture, and locks at midnight on that day.
* Career Coaching: Career coaching assignments do not lock, but are used during career coaching workshops; ensure you have completed the assignments by the start of the workshop.
* Prework: You should have already finished this; if not, you should reach out to your instructor, and finish any remaining items ASAP.

#### Graded out of points

* Code Challenges: Each code challenge is released at 5pm, to be worked on that night. The code challenge is due the next day by the start of lecture. You may resubmit code challenges for up to 10 days after the assignment is due; code challenges lock after 10 days.
* Labs: Each lab is released at 5pm, and should be worked on the next day during lab time. The lab is due by the start of the following lecture. You may resubmit labs for up to 10 days after the assignment is due; labs lock after 10 days.

## Topics

The latest list of topics and tools are available [here](https://www.codefellows.org/courses/code-401/advanced-software-development-in-java-with-springmvc-and-android/#topics).

## Career Coaching Curriculum

Three full days of Code 401 are dedicated to workshops and presentations that teach students the skills they'll need for their job search, such as personal branding techniques, effective networking practices, how to create an attractive resume, mastering personal and technical interviews, job search best practices, and more.

Additionally, during each Project Week, students present projects that will go into their professional portfolio. [Learn More »](https://www.codefellows.org/get-a-software-development-job)

## Learn with Stacked Modules

Concepts in each of our courses are taught using stacked modules, where a new concept is introduced in each class session, building upon what came before it. This is a challenging style that requires persistence, practice, and collaboration, but allows more concepts to be introduced over the length of the course. This method helps students learn and retain more information in a short period of time.

## Material Requirements

Students are required to bring their own laptop with plenty of free space on the hard drive. All students will be responsible for ensuring their computers contain the necessary tools to build and run the programs they write. These tools are available for any of MacOS/Windows/Linux, so students should use the operating system they are most comfortable with. By the first day of class, students will need:

* Java command line tools installed on their computer
* [IntelliJ IDEA (Community Edition)](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)
* The latest version of Google Chrome
* A GitHub account

## Professionalism

Punctuality, participation in discussions, completion of assignments, and demonstration of professional behaviors with others are required, in accordance with our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/codefellows/code-of-conduct). Attendance will be taken at the beginning of every class. Passing requires at least 90% attendance. Students should always contact the instructors ahead of time if they are unable to attend all or part of published class / lab hours.
