# Class 7: Interfaces And Other Class Relationships

Today's focus will be continuing to talk about inheritance in object-oriented programming, using interfaces and properties. We'll also compare and contrast different techniques for relating objects to each other.

## Class Outline

- Announcements
  - Results of aggregated weekly feedback
- Code review
- Warmup questions
- Lecture
  - Even more domain modeling
  - Interfaces
  - Comparing subclasses, interfaces, and properties
    - One-to-one, one-to-many/many-to-one, and many-to-many relationships
- Lab intro
- Code Challenge intro

## Learning Objectives

### Students will be able to

#### Describe and Define

- Interfaces
- One-to-one relationships
- One-to-many/many-to-one relationships
- Many-to-many relationships

#### Execute

- Constructing a contract between objects using interfaces
