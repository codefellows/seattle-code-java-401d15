# Class 6: Inheritance

Today we're going to learn more about object-oriented programming by using inheritance, subclassing, and type casting.

## Class Outline

- Announcements
- Code review
- Warmup questions
- Lecture
  - More domain modeling
  - Inheritance
    - Subclassing
    - Abstract classes
    - `super()`
    - Overriding methods
  - Type casting
- Lab intro
- Code Challenge intro

## Learning Objectives

### Students will be able to

#### Describe and Define

- Inheritance (in object-oriented programming)
- `abstract` classes
- `super()`
- Method overriding
- Type casting (in object-oriented programming)

#### Execute

- Implement object-oriented inheritance via subclassing and `extends`
- Create `abstract` classes to avoid duplicating code
- Override methods to achieve polymorphic behavior
