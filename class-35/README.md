# Class 35: Graphs

Today we'll be learning your sixth (and final) data structures in Java: graphs.

## Class Outline

- Announcements
  - Weekly feedback number 7! Please give lots of feedback!
- Code review
- Warmup questions
- Lecture
  - Data structures review
  - Graphs visual
  - Graphs code
- Lab intro
- Code Challenge intro

## Learning Objectives

### Students will be able to

#### Describe and Define

- Graphs
  - Vertices / vertexes
  - Edges
    - Undirected / bidirectional
    - Directed / unidirectional
    - Edge weights
  - "Islands"
  - Neighbors
  - Subgraphs
  - Degree
  - Complete graphs
  - Cyclic / acyclic
  - Adjacency matrices
  - Adjacency lists

#### Execute

- Implement graphs, and a few common operations
- Getting more comfortable with Big O time and additional space complexity

## Helpful Resources

- FYI, Java currently doesn't have a built-in graph data structure
- [JGraphT may be a good option, but I haven't used it personally](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~algorith/implement/jgrapht/implement.shtml)
