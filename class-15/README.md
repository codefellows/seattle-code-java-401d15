# Class 15: Trees

Today we'll be learning your fourth data structure in Java: trees.

## Class Outline

- Announcements
  - Weekly feedback number 3! Please give lots of feedback!
- Code review
- Warmup questions
- Lecture
  - Data structures review
  - Binary tree visual
  - Tree traversal methods
  - Binary search tree visual

- Lab intro
- Code Challenge intro

## Learning Objectives

### Students will be able to

#### Describe and Define

- Binary trees
- Binary search trees
- K-ary trees
- Pre-order, in-order, and post-order tree traversals
- Breadth-first tree traversals
- Root nodes
- Child / parent nodes
- Tree levels / height
- Balanced / self-balancing trees

#### Execute

- Implement binary / binary search trees, and a few common operations
- Getting more comfortable with Big O time and additional space complexity

## Helpful Resources

- [If you need a self-balancing binary tree or binary search tree in the Java standard library, use TreeMap](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/TreeMap.html)
