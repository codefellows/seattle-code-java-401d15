# Monetization And AdMob Ads

## Overview

Today, your app will integrate a few different kinds of ads via Google AdMob.

## Setup

Continue working in your `taskmaster` repository.

## Resources

* [AdMob Banner Ads](https://developers.google.com/admob/android/banner) {:_target="blank"}
* [AdMob Interstitial Ads](https://developers.google.com/admob/android/interstitial) {:_target="blank"}
* [AdMob Rewarded Ads](https://developers.google.com/admob/android/rewarded) {:_target="blank"}

## Feature Tasks

### Banner Ad

On the "Main" activity, add a banner ad to the bottom of the page and display a Google test ad there.

### Interstitial Ad

Add a button to the "Main" activity that allows users to see an interstitial ad. (In a real app, you'll want to show this during natural transitions/pauses in your app, but we don't really have that in this application.)

### Rewarded Ad

Add a button to the "Main" activity that allows users to see a rewarded ad using a Google test ad. When the user clicks the close button, the user should see their reward in a text field next to the button.
