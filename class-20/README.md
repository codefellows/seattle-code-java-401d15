# Project Week Kickoff

Today, we'll look at the requirements for your midterm projects.

## Day One: Domain Model, Databases, Deployment

- Create Java classes that represent all the information you're trying to track
- Create database tables that correspond to each Java class you're trying to store
- Build tables and columns to represent 1:M and M:M relations between tables in the database.  
- Create Java classes that interact with the database that perform CRUD operations on each of the Java classes.
- Deploy your code base to GitHub
- Create an Organization to represent your team and make sure all team members have access to create branches, push and pull from the repo
- Deploy a bare-bones version of your app to Heroku so you're sure it's online from day one and can contribute changes to there throughout the rest of the week

## Day Two: Minimum Viable Product

- Create a server that serves static resources with at least a homepage showing and describing the purpose of your project.
- Add API routes that prove you can make a connection to your deployed project:
  - add a `GET` route with URL parameters  
  - add a `POST` route with URL parameters and one that accepts date via
      the HTTP body  
  - add a `PUT` route that accepts a resource `id` via URL parameters and updates information according to data in the request body  
  - add a `delete` route that accepts a resource `id` via URL parameters and deletes something from the database  
- Confirm that you can push changes to the master branch in your GitHub repo and deploy them to your deployed server

## Day Three: Additional Features

- Expand on your deployed MVP and the patterns established in it.  
- Add additional features like more complex front-end UI or more serer-side processing to date between the client and the database.  
- Ensure you can make incremental changes and deploy them to the deployed
  application without catastrophic consequences.

## Day Four: Additional Features and Mock Presentation

- Continue building new features for your application
- **Author** a presentation for your application
  - Showcase why you've created your application
  - Showcase what you're doing in the application to show how it satisfies the
    reason why you made it
  - Showcase how you built what your application does
- Decide what you want to show as your presenting each part of the application
  - Consider what will be on the screen as your describing each part
  - Consider who will be describing what's happening at each part of the
    presentation
  - Consider who will be driving the server/computer/mobile phone as you
    give the presentation
  - Consider how windows will be arranged to maximize contextual understanding
    of the presentation
- Decide who will present each part of the presentation
- Practice the presentation
