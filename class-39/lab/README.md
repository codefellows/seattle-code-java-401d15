# Location

## Overview

Today, your app will add the user's location to a task automatically when that task is created.

## Setup

Continue working in your `taskmaster` repository.

## Feature Tasks

### Location

When the user adds a task, their location should be retrieved and included as part of the saved Task.

### Displaying Location

On the Task Detail activity, the location of a Task should be displayed if it exists.

## Documentation

Update your daily change log with today's changes.

## Stretch Goals

* Save the location as both a String and a lat/long coordinate pair.
* Allow a user to choose how specific of a location is saved: city, state, or country.

## Submission Instructions

* Continue working in your `taskmaster` repo.
* Work on a non-master branch and make commits appropriately.
* Update your README with your changes for today and screenshot of your work.
* Create a pull request to your master branch with your work for this lab.
* Submit the link to that pull request on Canvas. Add a comment with the amount of time you spent on this assignment.
