# Intent Filters

## Overview

Today, your app will allow users to "share" a photo from another app and open TaskMaster, ready to upload that image as part of a new task.

## Setup

Continue working in your `taskmaster` repository.

## Feature Tasks

### Adding a Task from Another Application

Add an intent filter to your application such that a user can hit the "share" button on an image in another application, choose TaskMaster as the app to share that image with, and be taken directly to the Add a Task activity with that image pre-selected.

## Stretch Goals

* Also allow users to share text content from another application, and have that automatically populated on the Add a Task activity.

## Submission Instructions

* Continue working in your `taskmaster` repo.
* Work on a non-master branch and make commits appropriately.
* Update your README with your changes for today and screenshot of your work.
* Create a pull request to your master branch with your work for this lab.
* Submit the link to that pull request on Canvas. Add a comment with the amount of time you spent on this assignment.

## Grading Rubric

* 4 pts  Intent filter added with share functionality
* 2 pts  README with description, screenshots, and daily change log
