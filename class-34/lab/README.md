# Polish and Publish TaskMaster

## Overview

Today, you will finish any remaining goals in polishing TaskMaster and go through the process of publishing to the Google Play Store.

## Setup

Continue working in your `taskmaster` repository.

## Resources

* [Google Play Store Console](https://play.google.com/console/)
* [Google's app publishing guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish)

## Feature Tasks

### App Polish

Ensure that your application follows Google's guidelines. Make sure to get rid of any warnings in your app.

### Build Final AAB

Build a signed AAB for your application. Include that AAB in your GitHub repo.

### Deployment to Play Store

> Note that becoming a developer with Google requires a one-time fee of $25. This is *almost certainly* worth it for the resume boost alone, but you may also partner up with a classmate to go through these steps.

In the Google Play Console, follow the checklist for uploading your app to the Play Store. Include any notes about this process in your README, as well as the link to where your application will one day live.
