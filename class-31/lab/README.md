# Testing Views with Espresso and Polishing TaskMaster

## Overview

Today, you'll add more Espresso UI tests to your application, and complete/fix up/polish any remaining feature tasks from previous labs.

## Setup

Continue working in your `taskmaster` repository.

## Resources

* [Espresso Testing](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/espresso){:_target="blank"}

## Feature Tasks

### Espresso Testing

Add more Espresso UI tests to your application, if you haven't already. Make sure you do at least these three tests:

* assert that important UI elements are displayed on the page
* tap on a task, and assert that the resulting activity displays the name of that task
* edit the user's username, and assert that it says the correct thing on the homepage

### Polish

Complete / fix up / polish any remaining feature tasks from previous days' labs.

## Stretch Goals

* Allow the user to specify on their settings page how many tasks should be shown on the homepage. Use this to dynamically display as many tasks as the user requests for display in the RecyclerView. Test this functionality using Espresso.
* Add in any other features or styling that you wish existed in TaskMaster.

## Submission Instructions

* Continue working in your `taskmaster` repo.
* Work on a non-master branch and make commits appropriately.
* Update your README with your changes for today and screenshot of your work.
* Create a pull request to your master branch with your work for this lab.
* Submit the link to that pull request on Canvas. Add a comment with the amount of time you spent on this assignment.

## Grading Rubric

* 2 pts  3 Espresso tests specified above
* 3 pts  Previous feature tasks all work correctly
* 1 pt   README with description, screenshots, and daily change log
