## Notes

### Creating a new Android Studio project

1. Open Android Studio
1. Choose "Start a new Android Studio project"
1. Choose "Empty Activity"
1. Choose an application Name
1. Choose a Package name (that is unique to you!)
1. Choose a Save location (make sure you create a folder to contain everything)
1. Select a Minimum SDK (we're going to use API 24 in this class)
1. Leave everything else default (we're using Java as our language, and we don't need the legacy android.support libraries)
1. Press Finish
